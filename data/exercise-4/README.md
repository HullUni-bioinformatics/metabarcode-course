## Exercise 4 - compare assignment strategies ##

__BLAST-based vs. Phylogenetic placement__

The idea of this exercise is to use the to perform taxonomic assignment for the 100 unknown _Notostraca_ queries that you have encountert in exercise 2, using both a BLAST-based and a Phylogenetic placement approach. THis can be done automatically using the __metaBEAT__ pipeline.
 
See if you can do it!
The data required for this exercise can be found in the `data` directory. If you get stuck there is a [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/HullUni-bioinformatics/metabarcode-course/blob/master/data/exercise-4/results_backup/metaBEAT_Notostraca.ipynb) that will walk you through the procedure in the `results_backup` directory.

__Good luck!__
