## Exercise 3 - exploring and handling NGS data ##

In the data directory we provide some example data for exploring the fastq format. Find instructions on your tasks and some discussion points in the google [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h9d0JrTsDLzsOV5klMkD47807dWTmcXN3uxoYp0ei64/). 

We also go through some basic read filtering/trimming strategies, as well as read merging and -clustering in the [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h9d0JrTsDLzsOV5klMkD47807dWTmcXN3uxoYp0ei64/) and provide usage examples in this [notebook]().
