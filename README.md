## EvoHull Reproducible Metabarcoding course repository
This repository contains the course materials for the @EvoHull "Reproducible Metabarcoding" course June 2015, run at the University of Hull, UK. It starts with an introduction to the command line and developing bioinformatics skills. Secondly it introduces uses to reproducible and modern metabarcoding approaches using scripts to standardise analyses. 

This repository should contain: 
- all the data we are working on
- some scripts (additional to metaBEAT)
- QIIME tutorial files
- link to documentation
- maybe some other misc
